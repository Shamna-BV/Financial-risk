# Financial-risk
This project predicts credit risk and loan eligibility using demographic, financial, and behavioral data. 
It aims to classify loan applicants into risk categories based on features like credit score, income, and payment history using ML models. 
The goal is to help financial institutions assess loan risks and make informed decisions.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the credit risk and loan eligibility of individuals based on demographic, financial, and behavioral data. Using machine learning models, the project aims to classify loan applicants into various risk categories (e.g., Low, Medium, High) based on features such as credit score, income, debt-to-income ratio, loan purpose, and more.

## Objectives:

1. Data Preprocessing:
  * Clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  * Analyze the relationships between features and the target variable (Risk Rating).
  * Visualize the distribution of loan purposes, credit scores, income, and debt-to-income ratios.

3.Modeling:
  * Predict the risk rating of loan applicants using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

4.Feature Importance:
  * Identify key factors influencing loan risk (e.g., income, credit score, payment history).

5.Model Optimization:
  * Tune hyperparameters to improve model performance using Grid Search or Random Search.
